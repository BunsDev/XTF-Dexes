One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second.

It was launched by Binance in September 2020 as the Binance Smart Chain, and relaunched in Feburary 2022 as BNB Chain. BNB uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority model which has allowed for low transaction fees and higher throughput. \r\n\r\nCompared to Ethereum which would usually cost hundreds to make a few transactions, BNB only charges less than a few dollars. BNB supports the BEP-20 token format, which is essentially the same format as ERC-20 but on a different chain, and transaction fees are paid in Binance’s native exchange token, BNB.",

Besides parachains, projects can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.",
